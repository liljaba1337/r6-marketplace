## Installation

NuGet package is coming soon. I plan to complete all the basic features, release the package and then work on improvements.

For now, you can clone the repo and reference it directly in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liljaba1337/r6-marketplace
```
Then add the `.csproj` to your solution or reference the compiled `.dll` manually.
